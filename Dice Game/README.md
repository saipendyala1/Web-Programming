# Dice Game
Website allows the user to select the number of dice, then roll dice. Then it shows the score based on the result of the roll he/she gets. I have used JavaScript at the backend to play game, to calculate points and display final score to the user after finishing the game.

# Technology
Backend: JavaScript
# 
Frontend: HTML5, CSS
